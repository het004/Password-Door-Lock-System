# Password-Door-Lock-System
Verilog HDL project for a password-based door locking system using FPGA.


# Password Based Door Lock System

This project is an FPGA-based password-protected door lock system implemented using Verilog HDL. The door unlocks only when the correct password is entered. The system also supports password changes.

## Features:
- Password-based security for door locking
- Modes: Door Lock, Door Unlock, Password Change
- Verilog HDL code compatible with FPGA platforms
- FSM-based design

## Components:
- Verilog HDL
- FPGA Board
- Clock, Reset, Door Sensor

## How It Works:
- Users can enter a password to unlock the door.
- The system verifies the password and opens or closes the door accordingly.
- A reset mechanism resets the system to its default state.

## Code:
The Verilog HDL code is included in the `door_system.v` file. 

## Report:
The full project report with a detailed explanation of the system is included in `fpga_report.pdf`.
